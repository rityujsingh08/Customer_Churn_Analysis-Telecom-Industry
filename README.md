📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

- Predicting customer churn is a crucial task for telecom companies seeking to retain their users and reduce customer attrition. This project explores, analyzes, and builds machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their service usage and demographic data.

🚀 Project Overview

The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project applies machine learning algorithms to classify customers as churners or non-churners using features from the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

Key stages include:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and encoding

  📚 Technologies Used

# Python 3.9+

- Pandas, NumPy — Data processing and wrangling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn — Data visualization
- Scikit-learn — Machine learning models and metrics
- Jupyter Notebook — Interactive environment for experimentation
